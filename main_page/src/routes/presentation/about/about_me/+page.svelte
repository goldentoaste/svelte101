<h1 class="title">About me</h1>
<p>
    My name is Ray, Im on my last year at University of Alberta. I am currently doing a Developer
    internship a SAP.
</p>

<p>
    My experience with Svelte started around 2022, when I knew very little about web dev. I was
    trying to get a React app together for an hackathon, it worked but just barely and I didn't have
    a good time. And thats when I learnt about Svelte, this framework that was making lots of bold
    promises at the time.
</p>

<p>
    For me, as a hobbyist, I think Svelte's streamlined reactivity and DX first philosophy makes it
    actually enjoyable to use, so that I can focus on making my website instead of wrestling with
    the framework.
