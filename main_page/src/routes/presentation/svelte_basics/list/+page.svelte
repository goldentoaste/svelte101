<h1 class="title">Lists Iteration</h1>

<p>
    In order to display a list of data, <b>{"{#each list as item, index (item.id)}"}</b>
    (each block) is used. In JSX usually 'list.map' would be used here, where as
    Svelte's syntax is more like a common for loop.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Index</b>, and the <b>(item.id)</b> is optional. Index is a 0-indexed number for which
    item its currenly on, useful for a numbered list for example.

    <br />

    <b>(item.id)</b> can be any property of the item object. It's used to label the
    rendered element with a unique id, is useful if you plan on rearranging list
    order, or add/remove items. This is similar to how JSX requires elements
    returned in list.map to have the key attribute.
